## 📝 Notes

- Each folder contains a small dataset and analysis code (Python notebooks or scripts).
- This repository is more focused on applying my latest learnings from Machine Learning concepts to biomedical datasets.
- Please note that if you want to run any of the projects, you must ensure that the dependencies are installed in your environment.

```Bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Future Plans
